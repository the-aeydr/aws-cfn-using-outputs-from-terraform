# AWS CloudFormation Sample Templates

Use the provided AWS CloudFormation templates to learn how to generate unique (or pseudo-unique) resouce names within AWS CloudFormation. It is recommended to invoke the CloudFormation templates using the `Makefile` task runner at the root of the repository, but it is possible to deploy these CloudFormation Stacks through the user interface.

These are sample templates, and not intended for launching production-level environments. Before launching a template, always review the resources that it will create and the permissions it requires.
